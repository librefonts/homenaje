  Homenaje is inspired by the bronze cemetery art found in the Recoleta and Chacaritas districts of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
A grotesque and narrow type, it provides economy in text setting without losing its strong, straight and steady features.
The name &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Homenaje&acirc;&euro; means tribute in Spanish, a modest way to honor the patient and accurate work of the lettering artists whose bronze letters honor a lifetime.
